\section*{Abstract}\label{abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

The main topic of this doctoral dissertation is on the analysis of
syntactic structures in language acquisition, specifically in the domain
of Czech and Slovak learners which acquire the Italian language. In
particular, I will focus on the complex noun phrase subdomain, showing
the compositionality of the phrase structure and the hierarchical
fashion of this component. The analysis is casted in the
Minimalist-oriented framework of the Generative Grammar
\citep{chomsky1995, chomsky1998, chomsky2013, hcf2002} and its
application in the field of the second language acquisition
\citep{rothmanslabakova2017, slabakovalealliskin2014}.

The usage of an established computational ground to conduct the work,
where the data retrieved by fieldwork is stored in a coherent corpus
which easily permits to be queried and interpolated for the research
purposes, represents a standpoint for this research in its totality,
yielding for a data-based approach to the whole process. The annotation
schema of the data is standardized in order to adhere to the major point
of discussion into the discipline
\citep{clark2010, kueblerzinsmeinster2015, kurdi2016}, representing the
plus to furnish a data source which is independent to the merely
contingent purposes.

This research aims to offer a way to investigate how second language
acquisition can be seen grounding on a coherent set of data in terms of
annotation schema: it does insist either on the speculative questions
both on computational models involved.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The main question of this thesis yields a twofold mindset that is not a
corollary of the research but which represents the process in which the
work was conducted: how could I investigate a particular area of the
language faculty as language acquisition in a way which can gain from
the usage of the digital instruments in order to ground the theoretical
analysis on actual data?

The idea under this research moves across the motivation to investigate
over an empirically-grounded path the strategies shown by the learners
during the acquisition of second languages, using an established
coherent digital architecture. My task is twofold: on one side this
provides for the developing of a theoretically-grounded framework to
research in the fields of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), while on
the other this necessitates to develop a linguistic corpus which collect
in a coherent fashion a wide set of data that represent some spotted
linguistic facts in order to give a transparent documentation of the
learning path. The usage of the modern tools in developing a linguistic
corpus yields for a fully documentable research path, in which is
possible to reconstruct the steps and the choices which underlie its
development, the methods used in the analysis, the correctness of the
outcomes. This kind of research is intimately multidisciplinar in
nature, embracing different approaches and areas of interest: digital
humanities, corpus and computational linguistics for the development of
the linguistic corpus, general and theoretical linguistics, studies on
SLA and interlanguage for the theoretical analysis.

This introductive chapter collects a preliminary way to represent the
main areas of the research, the methods involved in the analysis and the
possible outcomes of such a way to conduct the work.

\section{Background for the thesis}\label{background-for-the-thesis}

\subsection{Corpus-based approach: motivations for the
thesis}\label{corpus-based-approach-motivations-for-the-thesis}

Corpus based \citep{biber2010}

\subsection{Learner-based corpora of Italian L2: an
overview}\label{learner-based-corpora-of-italian-l2-an-overview}

Here I summarize the most representative Italian L2 learner corpora
available online:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\href{http://www.valico.org/valico_b_CORPUS.html}{GranVALICO}}
  and \textbf{\href{http://www.valico.org/valico_CORPUS.html}{VALICO}}
  \citep{valico}\\
  Learner corpora provided by Turin University. They represent the most
  valuable sources of Italian L2 corpora. They are composed by written
  texts composed by the students which have the assignment to describe
  the vignettes provided by the teachers. The corpora are accessible
  online with an advanced search that permits to filter the data by
  different parameters (e.g.~learners' L1 and education, assignments
  etc.).
\item
  \textbf{\href{http://merlin-platform.eu}{MERLIN}} \citep{merlin}\\
  The MERLIN Corpus represents a wide-range multilingual documented
  resource which collects 2.286 texts written by learners of Czech,
  Italian and German. Started in 2012, the main objective is to show the
  different levels of acquiring languages by the usage of written texts,
  relying on the CEFR level schema on L2 acquisition. The Italian-L2
  subcorpus contains 813 texts.
\item
  \textbf{\href{http://parlaritaliano.it/index.php/en/data/653-corpus-lips}{LIPS}}
  \citep{lips}\\
  The corpus contains the transcription of more than 2000 audio files by
  CILS - Certificazione di Italiano come Lingua Straniera (CILS) at the
  Università per Stranieri of Siena between the years 1993--2006. With
  more than 700k of words divided in \emph{monologues} and
  \emph{dialogues} between the candidate and the examiner, it represents
  one of the biggest corpus of Italian L2. The corpus is POS annotated
  using the tool Treetagger \citep{schmid1994}.
\item
  \textbf{\href{http://czech-it.github.io}{Czech-IT}} \citep{czech-it}\\
  The Czech-IT corpus contains chat messages, emails, coversations,
  surveys and assignments by \textgreater{}70 Czech and Slovak learners
  of Italian language\footnote{I am co-founder of the project.}. Started
  in 2017, it is fully accessible online while the data acquisition
  continues. The whole dataset is fully interrogable by an interactive
  interface and released with a Creative Commons license; POS and
  automatic tagging are in tune.
\item
  \textbf{\href{http://www.parlaritaliano.it/index.php/it/corpora-di-parlato/662-corpus-italiano-scritto-l2}{Corpus
  Italiano scritto L2}} \citep{vogheraturco2010}\\
  The corpus retains 227 written texts by undergraduate students of
  different native languages, which study Italian as a foreign language
  for their courses at the University of Greenwich. Learners' L1 are:
  albanian, bosniac, chinese, french, greek, english, norwegian,
  portuguese, spanish, tigrinya.\\
  The type of texts are: \emph{descriptive}, \emph{narrative} and
  \emph{argumental}. The texts are syntactically annotated and the
  tagset is available in xml format.

\section{Objectives of the thesis}\label{objectives-of-the-thesis}

The three main objectives of this thesis are methodological, empirical
and theoretical.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Methodological objectives}\\
  To address the decisions and the methods raised by the compilation,
  the storage and the design of a learner based corpus, exploring the
  effective procedures for retrieving the relevant features for the
  analysis;
\item
  \textbf{Empirical objectives}\\
  To explore the previous generalizations of the acquisitional path in
  SLA literature comparing with the amount of linguistic productions
  given by different learners;
\item
  \textbf{Theoretical objectives}\\
  To describe the features which are relevant for characterise the
  language variety effect and the place of interlanguage.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Methodological objectives}\label{methodological-objectives}

\subsection{Empirical objectives}\label{empirical-objectives}

Amongst many scholar the role of the native language (L1) has been
raised as a factor of possible conditionation in the way which the
target language (L2) is acquired during the learning path: an emblematic
case is the \emph{transfer} of the knowledge about the structures of the
L1 to the target, revealing the intermediate steps of the acquisitional
path defined with the term \emph{interlanguage} \citep{selinker1972},
that we can refer as to \textbf{Interlanguage Hypothesis} (IlH).
Different from this hypothesis --which recognizes a central place to the
native language in the acquisitional path-- is the \textbf{Monitor
Model} \citep{krashen1981}, a multi-focal perspective on language
acquisition where different factors are described as involved in the
process and where the L1 could not represent that conditionation.

During the last 20 years, a considerable part of linguistic literature
is involved in developing some sort of models to think how the faculty
of language can work, in its biological \citep{hcf2002}, computational
\citep{fodor2001} and cognitive components in a highly interdisciplinary
environment. Studies on SLA is a fertile field, which relies on
comparative and contrastive analyses of linguistic phenomena, either
both from an applied view \citep{ellis1994} than by theoretically
grounded perspective focused on Generative framework (GenSLA)
\citep{guasti2002, hawkins2001, rothmanslabakova2017, sorace2011}. In
this sense appears that the adoption of a general picture in which
analyze the variation in grammar into a \emph{parametric} model
\citep{chomsky1995} can be suitable for long-standing researches on SLA
and interlanguage.

The dataset used in this thesis aims to display either the different
linguistic outcomes in a wide range of communicative situations by the
same learner, both than a sociolinguistic grained analysis where the
variety of educational or age range can show different linguistic
behaviors in the range of learners' variety.

\subsection{Theoretical objectives}\label{theoretical-objectives}

From a theoretical viewpoint, the research is inserted in the current
theories that rely on the hierarchical functioning of the language
faculty, for which the variation among languages are reconducted to a
parametrizing of choice amongst the languages
\citep{adger2013, chomsky1995, chomsky1998, chomsky2013, chomsky2015, rizzi2013},
which are structurally constant, despite of the wideness of the
linguistic variation:

\begin{quote}
We are concerned, then, with states of the language faculty, which we
understand to be some array of cognitive traits and capacities, a
particular component of the human mind/brain. The language faculty has
an initial state, genetically determined; in the normal course of
development it passes through a series of states in early childhood,
reaching a relatively stable steady state that undergoes little
subsequent change, apart from the lexicon. To a good first
approximation, the initial state appears to be uniform for the species.
\citep{chomsky1995}
\end{quote}

This view permits on one side to compare the syntactic structures in a
coherent and schematic way, while on the other it concentrates moreover
on the hierarchical fashion of the language faculty than on the linear
order displayed by the utterances \citep{kayne1994, moro2000}. In this
perspective is generally assumed that the hierarchical phrase structure
plays a central role in syntactic computation, while the
\emph{flattering} of such structures into a mono-dimensional workspace
is a matter of externalization constraints and interface conditions
(e.g.~the need to give an ordered array where every item of the sentence
is present at one time in order to be spelled out). I will summarize
this in a representational way with the usual tree-diagram in
Fig.\ref{fig:tree1}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{phdThesis_files/figure-latex/tree1-1} 

}

\caption{Structural representation of a simple sentence}\label{fig:tree1}
\end{figure}

Given this way to proceed, that assures a coherent framework to compare
languages in a parametric way, the main theoretical question addressed
here concerns the relevance and the potential usage of this perspective
in the analysis of a dynamic system as during the acquisitional path and
the strategies raised up by learners during the various steps in the
interlanguage.

\section{Outline of the thesis}\label{outline-of-the-thesis}

The first year is dedicated to the setting-up of the corpus, with the
starting operations to acquire the data and elaborate a coherent way to
annotate the texts with a standard schema. During the second year the
corpus is planned to grow up for reach a significance level of
\textgreater{}15000 words in order to provide quantitative analyses.
Third and fourth year will be spent in developing the theoretical
analyses and refining the informatic architecture of the project,
evolving in a user-friendly and interrogable way to dispense the data.
The theoretical outcome constitues the main topic of the research.
