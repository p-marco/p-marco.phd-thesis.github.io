## Credits {-}



This project is constituted by files written in Markdown syntax and exported either as a standalone website both as printer-ready product.




This is due to the awesome work of the people behind different libraries:

* [Pandoc](https://bookdown.org)
* [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org) 
* [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org) and [R](https://bookdown.org) environment.

As well, for the computational infrastructure, a lot of open source tools have been used:

* [NLTK](https://bookdown.org)

For the typographic setting, the print-ready file is composed on LaTeX with the usage of SCRBOOK class and some custom component. I am aware I can't thank everyone on the web about that. By the way, thank you!
