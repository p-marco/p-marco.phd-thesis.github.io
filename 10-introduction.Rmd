# Introduction

The main question of this thesis yields a twofold mindset that is not a corollary of the research but which represents the process in which the work was conducted: how could I investigate a particular area of the language faculty as language acquisition in a way which can gain from the usage of the digital instruments in order to ground the theoretical analysis on actual data?

The idea under this research moves across the motivation to investigate over an empirically-grounded path the strategies shown by the learners during the acquisition of second languages, using an established coherent digital architecture. 
My task is twofold: on one side this provides for the developing of a  theoretically-grounded framework to research in the fields of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), while on the other this necessitates to develop a linguistic corpus which collect in a coherent fashion a wide set of data that represent some spotted linguistic facts in order to give a transparent documentation of the learning path.
The usage of the modern tools in developing a linguistic corpus yields for a fully documentable research path, in which is possible to reconstruct the steps and the choices which underlie its development, the methods used in the analysis, the correctness of the outcomes.
This kind of research is intimately multidisciplinar in nature, embracing different approaches and areas of interest: digital humanities, corpus and computational linguistics for the development of the linguistic corpus, general and theoretical linguistics, studies on SLA and interlanguage for the theoretical analysis. 

This introductive chapter collects a preliminary way to represent the main areas of the research, the methods involved in the analysis and the possible outcomes of such a way to conduct the work.








## Background for the thesis





### Data-based research: definition



### Data-based research: motivations for the thesis






## Objectives of the thesis

The three main objectives of this thesis are methodological, empirical and theoretical.

1. **Methodological objectives**  
To address the decision and the methods raised by the compilation, the storage and the design of a learner based corpus, exploring the effective procedures for retrieving the relevant features for the analysis;
1. **Empirical objectives**  
To explore the previous generalizations of the acquisitional path in SLA literature comparing with the amount of linguistic productions given by different learners;
1. **Theoretical objectives**  
To describe the features which are relevant for characterise the language variety effect and the place of interlanguage.


### Methodological objectives



### Empirical objectives


The role of the native language (L1) can conditionates deeply the way in which the target language (L2) is acquired during the learning path: an emblematic case is the *transfer* of the knowledge about the structures of the L1 to the target, revealing the interlanguage.

During the last 20 years, a considerable part of linguistic literature is involved in developing some sort of models to think how the faculty of language can work, in its biological [@hcf2002], computational [@fodor2001] and cognitive components in a highly interdisciplinary environment.
Studies on SLA is a fertile field, which relies on comparative and contrastive analyses of linguistic phenomena, either both from an applied view [@ellis1994] than by theoretically grounded perspective focused on Generative framework (GenSLA) [@guasti2002, @rothmanSlabakova2017, @hawkins2001, @sorace2011]. 
In this sense appears that the adoption of a coherent model to analyze the variation in grammar into a parametric model can be suitable for long-standing researches on SLA and interlanguage, also based on independent data-mining initiatives as in the case of the present purposes, which disentangles the data in a form of a linguistic corpus and the linguistic analysis.



### Theoretical objectives


From a theoretical viewpoint, the research is inserted in the current theories which rely on the hierarchical functioning of the language faculty, for which the variation among languages are reconducted to a parametrizing of choice among the structures of languages [@chomsky1995, @chomsky1998, @chomsky2013, @chomsky2015, @adger2013, @rizzi2013]. 
This view permits on one side to compare the syntactic structures in a coherent and schematic way, while on the other it concentrates moreover on the hierarchical fashion of the language faculty than on the linear order displayed by the utterances. 







## Outline of the thesis


The first year is dedicated to the setting-up of the corpus, with the starting operations to acquire the data and elaborate a coherent way to annotate the texts with a standard schema. During the second year the corpus is planned to grow up for reach a significance level of >15000 words in order to provide quantitative analyses.
Third and fourth year will be spent in developing the theoretical analyses and refining the informatic architecture of the project, evolving in a user-friendly and interrogable way to dispense the data.  The theoretical outcome constitues the main topic of the research.
