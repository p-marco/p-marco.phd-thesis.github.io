# Welcome

This is the repository of my ongoing Ph.D. thesis, which focuses on the analysis of second language acquisition domain under a linguistic theoretical framework.

You can browse the project in different ways: 

* By an online interface [HERE](http://marcopetolicchio.com/phd-thesis/book/)
* Using the PDF generated file [HERE](http://marcopetolicchio.com/phd-thesis/book/phdThesis.pdf)
* Using the LaTeX source code [HERE](http://marcopetolicchio.com/phd-thesis/book/phdThesis.tex)
* Using the MS Word DOCX file [HERE](http://marcopetolicchio.com/phd-thesis/book/phdThesis.docx)
* By the EPUB output format [HERE](http://marcopetolicchio.com/phd-thesis/book/phdThesis.epub)
* By the github repository [HERE](http://github.com/p-marco/phd-thesis) 

The best option is to directly use the online html interface, which provides at least 3 different way to express your thoughts:

* Annotate, highlight and share your proposal via the embedding of [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is)
* Adding a comment via [Disqus](http://disqus.com) component
* Suggest your editing on github either both opening a poll issue than directly editing the page you are referring to.
